Several dependencies are required:

Please download libflac, libogg and libvorbis from:
https://www.xiph.org/

Please download libsox from:
http://sox.sourceforge.net/

Library folders should be renamed as follows (strip off the version numbers):

libflac
libogg
libsox
libvorbis

Stripped down Visual Studio 2013 project files are included to compile the essentials (these were borrowed and adapted from libsox).
